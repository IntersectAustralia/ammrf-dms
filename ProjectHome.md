The Data Management System (DMS) addresses the needs of an increasing number of [AMMRF](http://www.ammrf.org.au) users who are using high-end instruments to produce large datasets. Those users are facing the demands of a new wave of data intensive instruments and software.

The DMS offers features in three areas:

  * Data capture: it has an API that allows developers to customise the data capture process, which in DMS terminology includes the ability to copy data from the instrument into a data repository and _attach_ metadata to it during this process.

  * Basic data management: It allows users to browse storage locaitons (instruments, ftp servers, even local drive) to copy data to and from different places. Data copy between two locations (when not the user's PC) is actually treated as third-party copy, so no user intervention is required.

  * Data advertisement: the metadata catalogue has been configured with RIF-CS, [ANDS](http://www.ands.org.au), so users can advertise collections in the [Research Data Australia](http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/) federated catalogue.
