Some notes to improve installer:
1. split installer, so scripts can be called separatelly
2. tomcat installation
    $ useradd -m tomcat
    $ to run tomcat user, well, that's another pain
    $ copy new /etc/init.d/tomcat6 (see one of the installed servers)
    $ chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/share/apache-tomcat-6.0.26
    
BUGS/ENHANCEMENTS
- use a single user (tomcat)
- include tomcat and solr as part of installation
- fast track for dm14, dm12
- check services running
- need to change permissions of unziped dms-worker folder
- check/create /var/dms folder (custom check for property)
- solr: need conf/solrconfig.xml with
   <dataDir>${solr.data.dir:/home/tomcat/.ammrf/dms/solr/data}</dataDir>
- bug: routing properties are written not as '*' but resolving files
