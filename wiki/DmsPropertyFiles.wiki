#summary DMS's property files

= Location =

If you inspect most of _applicationContext_ files, you will find snippets like the following
{{{
        ...
        <context:property-placeholder
                properties-ref="dmsProperties" ignore-unresolvable="true" />

        <util:properties id="dmsProperties"
                location="file://${dms.config.home}/dms.properties" />
        ...
}}}

The first tag configures in the spring context a resolver for properties. It has *ignore-unresolvable* on, because the application uses the ability of the [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/beans.html Spring IoC] container to load multiple XML definitions at once, and as the DMS has different property files for some, then all must ignore properties that don't belong to them.

The second one tells that the required property file for that XML context definition resides in *dms.config.home*, which is a system property. This is the location of all properties files.

In the following sections we describe all the property files and the meaning of each property.
