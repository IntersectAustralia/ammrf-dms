#summary DMS ACMM specific architecture

= Introduction =

The DMS can be _wired_ in different ways. This page explains briefly the current ACMM setup, providing specifics in regards to deployment and current wiring of beans.

The DMS is deployed in one machine, running the following java processes:

  # ActiveMQ, the JMS broker
  # Worker process
    # Transport implementations for *local*, *ftp* and *hdd*
    # Triggers and harvesters for all instruments (dms-instrument)
  # Tomcat, with three web applications
    # Web application (dms-web)
      # DMS service (dms-service)
      # Booking gateway (dms-booking)
    # Http tunnel
    # Apache solr

= Changing the configuration =

== Relocating components ==

By modifying basic property files, one can achieve easily the following:

  * Scale horizontally by providing more workers. One will need to change dms_routing.properties and the corresponding properties for each worker.

  * Deploy tunnel and/or solr in another server by relocating the war. One issue which hasn't been tested though is when the applet points to a different server.

  * Deploy multiple brokers, one in the server and one _slave_ for the worker. This configuration allows to deploy the worker machine inside an Intranet while the main server lives outside.
