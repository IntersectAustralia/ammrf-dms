#summary General aspects of DMS architecture

= Introduction =

The DMS is a multi-tier distributed system based on Java EE frameworks. It uses the Spring framework, particularly [http://www.springsource.org/roo Spring Roo] and [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html Spring MVC] on the web layer; application integration through [http://camel.apache.org/ Apache Camel] and [http://activemq.apache.org/ Apache ActiveMQ] as JMS messaging middle-ware; a custom built data transfer API -including HTTP tunneling to the browser via Java Applets-; and custom metadata ingestion API with a [http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ Apache Solr] indexing back-end.

Although it may be deployed in several ways, with minor or major changes, the overall picture of the DMS can be illustrated by the following diagram

(It is worth noticing that the SVN repository code actually contains a particular instantiation of this configuration; names in italic will correspond to name maven modules in the source when appropriate;  hopefully this document will show developers how to change it to fit other requirements.)

As shown, the main components of the DMS are:
  # The web application _(dms-web)_ : contains the views, controllers and all classes that make up the web interface, including the authentication extension to Spring security.
  # The dms service _(dms-service)_ : the component in charge of persisting jobs and handling worker routing. It could be run independently, but it is being deployed as a Spring bean in the web application, so it runs inside Tomcat.
  # Solr _(dms-catalogue-)_: deployed by the installation script and used in catalogue module to provide high-performance indexing functionality. The catalogue _bean_ interacts with Solr via a REST interface.
